      <h4><font color="black"><i>What unites these, and countless other professions?</i> </h4>

      <p id = "introParagraph"> <b>Hands.</b> Their work environment is dominated by hands-on labor. They do not sit in front of a computer screen – rather, they work in a dynamic world filled with people and items to engage with, react to, and manipulate. Technology has revolutionized the way many jobs are done, but it hasn’t yet changed the way people use their skilled hands to work. This is due, in large part, to the requirement that mainstream technical devices require hands to operate them. The solution might be to genetically engineer humans with 10 hands, but until then, we believe intelligent heads-up displays can greatly enhance many work environments by providing the information you need, when you need it most – when your hands are engaged in whatever you’re working on.
        <br><br>
        With the recent trend towards wearable technology, we believe these work environments can be transformed by technology. We set out to explore the potential of one such technology, Google Glass, for a variety of work environments. This site contains the results of our labor, including the interfaces we built, demonstrations of our prototypes, and tutorials instructing you how to use our system.

        Imagine you're working late in the lab. Perhaps you’re a bio major, and you’ve just been assigned a new protocol to complete by morning. Or maybe you’ve been working for years to identify a stronger vaccine to the flu, and you think you’ve hit a breakthrough. No matter who you are, or what you’re doing, when you’re in the lab your hands will be busy and you’ll be wearing protective equipment. This will make accessing a computer to reference a protocol, set a timer, or take a picture challenging and distracting.
        <br> <br>
        Described here are typical lab scenarios we encountered during our interviews with lab workers. Their intensive hands-on environment limits their access to common technical tools such as computers, cameras, and smartphones, which often cannot be accessed due to an individual’s protective equipment (gloves, suit, mask, respirator). For these reasons, lab workers often carry nothing but paper and their brain with them as reference into the lab. While this may be safer, it limits productivity. The paradox of the situation seems clear: we live in a world where the answer is always just a click away, yet lab workers are stuck in an environment unaided by these technologies.
        We present here how our prototypes provide an innovative technical solution in the lab environment.

        Our world is filled with motion and change, however much of this is unperceivable to humans without sensors. With Glass, information gained through sensors can be perceived instantly by humans thanks to the head mounted display. We demonstrate here a variety of tools and capabilities we have developed that lay the groundwork for smart, sensor driven applications.
