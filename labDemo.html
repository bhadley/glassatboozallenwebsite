      <p>Lab workers are constantly completing high quality, skilled labor tasks with their hands.

                                <ul><li>Yes- Report the inventory and accessioning team members with completed documentation
                                  <li> No- Accept! stamp receive date and initials. Record the placement of item to the specific location and condition (temperature, safety cabinet, etc.).</li></ul>

                                <p> You must input these instructions to our site in a format Glass will understand. We have built a visual user interface to help you do that, which allows you to literally build a decision tree on the screen. Read the instructions on how to manipulate the diagram, then create a diagram similar to the following:
                                </p>
                                <img src="images/labDiagram.png" width="100%">
                              </li>
                              <li class="list-group-item">
                                <p> Once your diagram is complete, click the <code> Submit </code> button to save it to our database.
                                </p>

                              </li>
                              <li class="list-group-item">
                                <p>You will then see the package image code you can use to pull up this protocol with Google Glass. Click the <code> Download Image </code> link to download and save it to your computer. You can print this, laminate it, and tape it to the area where you receive packages. Or tape it to a binder you use in the lab. Now grab your Google Glass, and head to that package! </p>

                              <li class="list-group-item">
                                <p>Put Glass on and ensure it's awake. On the Glass homescreen, say "ok glass", then "My Scan". This will launch the camera activity, and you will see what Glass sees in the screen. Now look at the qr code you downloaded. It will be recognized instantly, and Glass will chime cheerfully. 
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-group-item">
                                  <p>You'll then momentarily see a "Loading..." screen, while Glass downloads the data from the database. Soon, the first step in the protocol will be displayed. To proceed to the next step, rotate your head to the right. To go back, move your head to the left. If you've added a timer to a step, that timer will be displayed in a pop-up text box, as seen below. This will occur even if you've moved past the step that launched the timer. If you've added an image, that image will appear on a screen after the text for that step.<p>
